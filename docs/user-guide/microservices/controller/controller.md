Scene Controller Microservice fuses multimodal sensor data to enable spatial analytics at the
edge for multiple use cases.

## Overview

The Scene Controller Microservice answers the fundamental question of `What, When and Where`. It receives object detections from multimodal inputs (primarily multiple cameras), contextualizes them in a common reference frame, fuses them and tracks objects over time.

The Scene Controller's output provides various insights for the tracked objects in a scene, including location, object visibility across cameras, velocity, rotation, center of mass. The Analytics microservice consumes this output to add region-of-interest, tripwire, and sensor-correlation analytics on top of it — see [Analytics Service](../analytics/analytics.md) for details.

To deploy the scene controller service, refer to the [Get Started](./get-started.md) guide. The service supports configuration through specific arguments and flags, which default to predefined values unless explicitly modified.

### Configurable Arguments and Flags

`--maxlag`: Maximum allowable delay for incoming messages. If a message arrives more than 1 second late, it will be discarded by the Scene Controller. This threshold can be adjusted to accommodate longer inference times, ensuring no messages are discarded. Discarded messages will appear as "FELL BEHINDS" in the service logs.

`--broker`: Hostname or IP of the MQTT broker, optionally with `:port`.

`--brokerauth`: Authentication credentials for the MQTT broker. This can be provided as `user:password` or as a path to a JSON file containing the authentication details.

`--resturl`: Specifies the URL of the REST server used to provide scene configuration details through the REST API.

`--restauth`: Authentication credentials for the REST server. This can be provided as `user:password` or as a path to a JSON file containing the authentication details.

`--rootcert`: Path to the CA (Certificate Authority) certificate used for verifying the authenticity of the server's certificate.

`--cert`: Path to the client certificate file used for secure communication.

`--ntp`: NTP server.

`--tracker_config_file`: Path to the JSON file containing the tracker configuration. This file is used to enable and manage time-based parameters for the tracker.

`--reid_config_file`: Path to the JSON file containing Re-ID (Re-Identification) configuration. This file controls Re-ID specific settings such as stale feature timeout, feature accumulation thresholds, similarity metric selection, and similarity scoring. See [Extended Re-ID](./Extended-ReID.md) for details.

By default, `similarity_metric` is `COSINE` with a threshold of `0.5`. Re-ID
vectors are normalized before write/query and Scenescape uses an inner-product
backend path (VDMS `IP` / Qdrant DOT); similarity scores are expected in
`[-1, 1]`. Set the metric to `L2` for distance-style matching, where lower
values are better.

`--schema_file`: Specifies the path to the JSON file that contains the metadata schema. By default, it uses [metadata.schema.json](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/scenescape/blob/main/controller/src/schema/metadata.schema.json). This schema outlines the structure and format of the messages processed by the service.

`--visibility_topic`: Specifies the topic for publishing visibility information, which includes the visibility of objects in cameras. Options are `unregulated`, `regulated`, or `none`. Default is `regulated`.

`--pose-adjustment`: Enables pose-based bounding box adjustment before world projection. When enabled, the controller uses pose keypoints (e.g. from a `yolo11n-pose` model) to refine the bounding box used for projecting detections into world coordinates. This is disabled by default. Cannot be used together with Extended ReID (cross-camera re-identification via the configured vector backend); see [Extended Re-ID](./Extended-ReID.md) for details. Can also be enabled via the `CONTROLLER_ENABLE_POSE_ADJUSTMENT` environment variable set to `true`. Requires the DL Streamer video pipeline to use a pose estimation model that provides keypoint data. See the [DL Streamer Pipeline Server documentation](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/scenescape/blob/main/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/README.md#enable-pose-estimation) for pipeline setup.

`--pose_adjustment_config_file`: JSON file that defines pose-adjustment label routing. The default file is `pose-adjustment-route.json` next to the controller executable. Use this file to map each registered pose-adjustment strategy label to the incoming labels that should dispatch to it.

Example `pose-adjustment-route.json`:

```json
{
  "person": ["human", "pedestrian"],
  "vehicle": ["car", "truck", "sedan"]
}
```

Resolution order is: exact label, then configured route labels. Routes are flattened at startup so message-time dispatch remains a direct lookup.

`CONTROLLER_TRUSTED_POSITIONING_SOURCES`: Comma-separated list of external `source_id`s (see
[External Source Input Message Format](./data_formats.md#external-source-input-message-format))
authorized to publish poses already expressed in a target scene's local coordinates (the
`scene` pose reference frame), intended for the Scenescape positioning service. Unset or empty
trusts no source. There is no corresponding CLI flag.

`CONTROLLER_EXTERNAL_SOURCE_BINDINGS`: Optional manual publisher→scene bindings
(`publisher_id:scene_uid,publisher_id:scene_uid2,...`). Required for `reference_frame: scene`
poses. For `wgs84`, unset means geospatial auto-attach to every geo-calibrated scene.

External-source object identity (`objects[*].id`) requires no environment variable or
per-source configuration: every external source's `id` is trusted directly as global track
identity by default, protected at runtime by automatic identity-collision detection. See
[Trusted Identity by Default, with Collision Detection](./data_formats.md#trusted-identity-by-default-with-collision-detection)
for details and guidance on choosing a `source_id`/`id`.

### Configuration

For detailed configuration guidance:

- Tracker configuration: See [How to Configure the Tracker](./how-to-configure-tracker.md)
- Re-ID configuration: See [Extended Re-ID](./Extended-ReID.md)
- Observability (experimental): See [How to Enable Observability](../../other-topics/how-to-enable-observability.md)

### Observability (Experimental)

The Scene Controller ships with **experimental** OpenTelemetry
instrumentation that can export metrics and distributed traces to an
OpenTelemetry Collector over insecure OTLP/gRPC. Both signals are disabled
by default and are toggled with the `CONTROLLER_ENABLE_METRICS` and
`CONTROLLER_ENABLE_TRACING` environment variables (endpoints are configured
via `CONTROLLER_METRICS_ENDPOINT` and `CONTROLLER_TRACING_ENDPOINT`).

> **⚠️ Experimental.** Metric names, span names, attributes, and
> configuration keys may change between releases, and the current
> implementation supports only insecure OTLP export. Do not enable on
> untrusted networks or rely on this instrumentation for long-lived
> dashboards without pinning versions.

For the full list of variables, exported instruments, and setup steps see
[How to Enable Observability](../../other-topics/how-to-enable-observability.md).

## Input/Output Message Formats

For details on the MQTT message formats accepted and produced by the Scene Controller, see [Scenescape Controller Data Formats](./data_formats.md).

## Sequence Diagram: Scene Controller Workflow

The Scene Controller Microservice receives detections from the camera and processes them to track moving objects, then publishes unregulated (raw) scene detections through MQTT. The Analytics microservice consumes this output to add regulated (filtered and formatted) detections, region/tripwire events, and sensor correlation. A Multi Object Tracker Loop is involved in managing detections within MQTT.
