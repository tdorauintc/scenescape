## Navigate Intel® SceneScape User Interface

By default, Intel® SceneScape provides two scenes that you can explore that are running from stored video data.

### Time To Complete UI Walkthrough

5-15 minutes

### Prerequisites For Exploring User Interface

-  Complete all steps in the [GettingStarted](Getting-Started-Guide.md) section.

### Explore User Interface
On local desktop, open browser and connect to https://localhost.  If running remotely, connect using `"https://<ip_address>"` or `"https://<hostname>"`, using the correct IP address or hostname of the remote Intel® SceneScape system. Upon first connection a certificate warning is expected, click the prompts to continue to the site. For example, in Chrome click "Advanced" and then "Proceed to &lt;ip_address> (unsafe)".

> **Note:** These certificate warnings are expected due to the use of a self-signed certificate for initial deployment purposes. This certificate is generated at deploy time and is unique to the instance.

* Navigate through the scenes and view the system configuration. For example, clicking on the “3D” icon on the “Queueing” scene shows the 3D rendering of that scene with green boxes representing the detected position of people moving in the scene.
