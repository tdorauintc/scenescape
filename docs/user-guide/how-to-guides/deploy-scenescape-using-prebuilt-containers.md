# Deploy Scenescape (Prebuilt Containers)

This guide explains how to deploy Scenescape using prebuilt Docker images, primarily from Docker Hub.

## 1. Set Up Docker Environment

Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system. For help, refer to [Installing Docker on your system](../get-started/system-requirements.md#required-software).

## 2. Generate secrets and download OpenVINO Model Zoo models

```bash
make init-secrets install-models
```

## 3. Use Prebuilt Images for Scenescape Deployment

Prebuilt containers are published on Docker Hub:

- [Scenescape Manager](https://hub.docker.com/r/intel/scenescape-manager)
- [Scenescape Controller](https://hub.docker.com/r/intel/scenescape-controller)
- [Scenescape Analytics](https://hub.docker.com/r/intel/scenescape-analytics)
- [Scenescape Autocalibration](https://hub.docker.com/r/intel/scenescape-autocalibration)
- [Scenescape Tracker](https://hub.docker.com/r/intel/scenescape-tracker)
- [Scenescape Cluster Analytics](https://hub.docker.com/r/intel/scenescape-cluster-analytics)
- [Scenescape Mapping](https://hub.docker.com/r/intel/scenescape-mapping)

## 4. Start Services

Start the demo without rebuilding local images (relies entirely on the prebuilt containers):

```bash
SUPASS=<password> DEMO_REBUILD_IMAGES=false make demo
```

> `DEMO_REBUILD_IMAGES=false` skips the re-building images locally from source.

## 5. Load Scenes with the Scene Upload Tool

The database starts empty; nothing is preloaded at startup. `make demo` already
uploads the sample scenes for you once the deployment is healthy, by calling
`make demo-scenes`, which runs the standalone `tools/upload_scenes/upload-scenes`
client against `sample_data/demo_scenes` (one subdirectory per scene, each
holding a `<scene>.zip` as produced by the "Export Scene" button of the web UI,
plus optional `assets.json` / `calibration_markers.json` sidecars). Scenes that
already exist are skipped, so re-running it is safe.

Install the tool's dependencies once with
`pip install -r tools/upload_scenes/requirements.txt`.

To load your own scenes into an already-running deployment, point the tool at
a different directory of per-scene subdirectories (each with its own `<scene>.zip`):

```bash
python3 tools/upload_scenes/upload-scenes \
  --restauth manager/secrets/controller.auth \
  --rootcert manager/secrets/certs/scenescape-ca.pem \
  https://web.scenescape.intel.com/api/v1 ./my-scenes
```

`--restauth` also accepts a `user:password` string, and `--insecure` skips
certificate verification when the deployment is reached under a name the
certificate was not issued for, such as `https://localhost`.

Verify that all containers are running:

```bash
docker ps
```

## 6. Import Scenes

After the services are up, scenes can be imported either via API (`curl`) or the Web UI.

### 6.1 Using `curl`

1. Obtain an authentication token:

   ```bash
   curl --location --insecure -X POST -d "username=admin&password=<password>" https://<ip_address>/api/v1/auth
   ```

   > Note: `<password>` is the same as used in `SUPASS=<password> make demo`.

2. Upload the scene ZIP:

   ```bash
   curl -k -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: Token <token>" \
     -F "zipFile=@<path_to_zip>" \
     https://<ip_address>/api/v1/import-scene/
   ```

### 6.2 Using the Web UI

1. Log in with admin credentials.
2. Navigate to **Import Scene**.
3. Select and upload the scene ZIP.
