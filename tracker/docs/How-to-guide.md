# How to Deploy Scenescape with Tracker + Analytics

This guide explains the Docker Compose workflow to deploy the Tracker service
together with the standalone Analytics service (without the Scene Controller).

The Tracker publishes tracked objects on `scenescape/data/scene/...`. The
Analytics service consumes that topic and publishes regulated detections,
region/tripwire events, and sensor-correlated output.

## Build and start Tracker + Analytics

1. Export the super-user password (required by the web service):

```bash
export SUPASS=<your-password>
```

2. Build images (ensure the `tracker` and `analytics` images are available):

```bash
# Builds all images including non-core tracker image
make build-all
```

3. Start the Tracker and Analytics services:

```bash
# Starts tracker + analytics (analytics is included in the tracker profile)
docker compose --profile tracker up -d
```

Notes:

- The `tracker` Compose profile starts both the `tracker` and `analytics`
  services. The Scene Controller (`scene`) is not started.
- If you also need the mapping or cluster-analytics services, add
  `--profile mapping` and/or `--profile cluster-analytics`.

### Stop

```bash
docker compose --profile tracker down
```

## Start Tracker + Analytics demo with `demo-tracker`

The repository `Makefile` provides a `demo-tracker` target which builds
everything, initializes sample data, and starts Docker Compose with the
`tracker` profile.

Usage:

```bash
# Set super-user password then run demo-tracker
export SUPASS=<your-password>
make demo-tracker
```

What `demo-tracker` does:

- Runs `make build-all` to build all images
- Runs `make init-sample-data` to prepare volumes and sample files
- Invokes the compose helper with: `--profile tracker`

### Stop Tracker + Analytics demo

```bash
docker compose --profile tracker down
```

### Restart Tracker + Analytics demo

```bash
docker compose --profile tracker up -d
```
