# 🧭 CI Migration Tracker: Jenkins → GitHub Actions

This document tracks the progress of migrating our CI/CD pipelines from **Jenkins (Jenkinsfile + Groovy)** to **GitHub Actions**.

---

## 📦 Migration Goals

- ✅ Replace Jenkins stages with GitHub Actions workflows or composite actions
- ✅ Reuse modular scripts (`.sh`) and composite actions (`action.yml`)
- ✅ Maintain feature parity (build types, environments, artifacts, ...)
- ✅ Improve transparency and ease of collaboration

## 🧪 Migration Testing Workflow

A temporary GitHub Actions workflow is used to test each migrated stage individually.

**File**: `.github/workflows/migration-tests.yml`
**Trigger**: Manual via `workflow_dispatch` or on `ci/migration-*` branches
