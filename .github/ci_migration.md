# üß≠ CI Migration Tracker: Jenkins ‚Üí GitHub Actions

This document tracks the progress of migrating our CI/CD pipelines from **Jenkins (Jenkinsfile + Groovy)** to **GitHub Actions**.

---

## üì¶ Migration Goals

- ‚úÖ Replace Jenkins stages with GitHub Actions workflows or composite actions
- ‚úÖ Reuse modular scripts (`.sh`) and composite actions (`action.yml`)
- ‚úÖ Maintain feature parity (build types, environments, artifacts, ...)
- ‚úÖ Improve transparency and ease of collaboration

## üß™ Migration Testing Workflow

A temporary GitHub Actions workflow is used to test each migrated stage individually.

**File**: `.github/workflows/migration-tests.yml`
**Trigger**: Manual via `workflow_dispatch` or on `ci/migration-*` branches

## üßë‚Äçüíª Collaboration Guidelines

- Branch naming: `ci/migration-<stage>`
- Open PRs referencing this file and the relevant issue
- Use checklist in PRs:
  - [ ] Replicate stage logic
  - [ ] Create/Update composite action
  - [ ] Add necessary bash script
  - [ ] Validate output with debug
  - [ ] Document result here
