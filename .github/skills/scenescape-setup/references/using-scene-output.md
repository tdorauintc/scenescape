# Building something with the deployed scene's output

Read this after every successful full deploy reaches `DEPLOY COMPLETE` (required handoff in
`SKILL.md`), and whenever the user wants to _use_ the tracked-object data for something — an
alert, a dashboard, a count, an integration with another system — rather than just view it in the
web UI. This is the handoff point from "deploy SceneScape" to "build an application on top of
SceneScape."

## Ask what the user is trying to accomplish

Don't assume the goal from the deployment context alone (e.g. "warehouse" doesn't imply "count
forklifts"). A short clarifying question upfront avoids wiring up the wrong topic or event type.
After a successful deploy, always end with this question (even if the user has not asked yet):

> "Now that the scene is tracking, what do you want to do with that data? For example: trigger an
> alert when someone enters/leaves an area, count objects over time, integrate with another
> system, or something else?"

The answer determines which of the paths below to take — often more than one applies.

## If the user isn't sure — suggest concrete analytics

Some users know their goal already; others just deployed SceneScape and want ideas for what's
possible. If they say "I don't know" / "what can I do with this?", offer a few concrete,
commonly-useful analytics rather than re-asking the same open question:

| Idea                          | How it's built from scene output                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Footfall / traffic counting   | Tripwire at an entrance; count crossings by `direction` over time                                                                   |
| Dwell time / occupancy        | Region around the area of interest; track how long each object ID stays in `objects`                                                |
| Zone utilization / heatmap    | Aggregate `translation` positions from the regulated topic over time, bucketed by area                                              |
| Queue length monitoring       | Region over the queue; alert when `counts` exceeds a threshold                                                                      |
| Queue dwell time / spacing    | Region over the queue; average `exited[].dwell` (finalized) and nearest-neighbor `translation` distances between co-present objects |
| Cross-camera path tracking    | Follow an object ID's `translation`/`visibility` across the regulated topic over time                                               |
| Loitering / anomaly detection | Region + a time threshold on how long an object ID remains without leaving                                                          |
| Demographic rollups           | Aggregate age/gender/other `metadata` attributes from the regulated topic (if the vision pipeline provides them)                    |

Suggest picking one or two to prototype first (e.g. "footfall counting via a tripwire" is usually
the fastest to demo), confirm the topic/event is flowing, then expand from there rather than
committing to a large integration design upfront.

## Common paths

| Goal                                                                | What to use                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Consume live tracked-object positions/attributes as they update     | Subscribe to `scenescape/regulated/scene/<scene_uid>` (below)                 |
| Fire an action when objects enter/exit a specific area              | Create a **region** (ROI), subscribe to its event topic (below)               |
| Fire an action when an object crosses a line (e.g. entry/exit door) | Create a **tripwire**, subscribe to its event topic (below)                   |
| Tag tracked objects with external sensor data (badge, temperature)  | [singleton-sensors.md](./singleton-sensors.md)                                |
| Keep a vision-detected attribute from flickering between frames     | [attribute-persistence.md](./attribute-persistence.md)                        |
| Get more accurate size/shape reasoning for a specific object class  | [object-library.md](./object-library.md)                                      |
| Tracking quality itself is the problem (flicker, wrong Re-ID, etc.) | [tuning-tracker.md](./tuning-tracker.md) / [tuning-reid.md](./tuning-reid.md) |

After wiring up the first path, circle back and ask if the user wants another — most real
integrations combine at least two (e.g. a region for dwell-time counting _and_ a tripwire for
entry/exit events).

## Consuming the regulated scene topic

`scenescape/regulated/scene/<scene_uid>` is the primary output topic — one rate-controlled message
per scene update containing every tracked object (position, velocity, size, attributes, any tagged
sensor readings). The **analytics** service publishes this topic (and region/tripwire events);
the scene controller publishes unregulated per-category tracks that analytics consumes. This is
the right starting point for most integrations (dashboards, counting, custom alerting logic)
since it needs no additional scene configuration.

```bash
docker container run --rm --network <project>_scenescape \
  -v <deploy_dir>/secrets/certs/scenescape-ca.pem:/ca.pem:ro \
  eclipse-mosquitto:2.1-alpine \
  mosquitto_sub -h broker.scenescape.intel.com -p 1883 \
  --cafile /ca.pem --insecure \
  -t 'scenescape/regulated/scene/<scene_uid>' -C 1 -W 120
```

Each message's `objects` array has one entry per tracked object: `category`/`type`, `translation`
(scene-metre position), `velocity`, `visibility` (which cameras see it), and a `metadata` map for
any pipeline-detected attributes (age, gender, license plate, etc. depending on the model). See
`docs/user-guide/microservices/analytics/data_formats.md` in the SceneScape repo (section
"Regulated Scene Output Message Format") for the full field reference.

For a one-off application, poll this topic directly; for anything long-running, have the consumer
app subscribe persistently rather than re-invoking `mosquitto_sub -C 1` in a loop.

## Regions (ROIs) and tripwires — event-driven paths

Regions and tripwires publish their own event topics (only when something crosses/enters/exits,
not on every tick), which is usually a better fit than filtering the full regulated topic yourself
when the goal is "notify me when X happens" rather than "give me continuous state." The
**analytics** service owns these event topics — confirm `docker compose ps analytics` shows the
service Up before debugging empty region/tripwire traffic.

- **Region** (`scenescape/event/region/<scene_uid>/<region_id>/objects`) — publishes `counts`,
  `entered`, `exited`, and the current `objects` inside the region whenever membership changes.
  Good for occupancy/dwell-time/zone-based alerting. Dwell time doesn't need custom timestamp
  bookkeeping: each object currently inside carries a live `regions.<region_id>.dwell` (elapsed
  seconds so far), and each entry in `exited` carries a finalized `dwell` for that visit — both
  computed server-side by the controller.
- **Tripwire** (`scenescape/event/tripwire/<scene_uid>/<tripwire_id>/objects`) — publishes once per
  crossing, with a `direction` field (`1`/`-1`) on each crossing object. Good for entry/exit
  counting across a doorway or line.

**Both are drawn shapes, so guide the user to the web UI rather than asking for raw coordinates**
(same reasoning as [singleton-sensors.md](./singleton-sensors.md)'s circle/poly guidance — a region
is a polygon and a tripwire is a line, and both are meant to be drawn on the scene map):

1. Sign in to the manager web UI (`https://localhost`, superuser credentials in
   `secrets/supass`). Do not use `web.scenescape.intel.com` in a browser - that hostname is only a
   Docker network alias, not resolvable from the host.
2. Open the scene's detail page, then use the **Regions** or **Tripwires** panel to draw the
   shape directly on the scene map.
3. Note the region/tripwire name shown after saving — the `region_id`/`tripwire_id` in the MQTT
   topic is its UUID, which can be read back via `GET /api/v1/regions` or `GET /api/v1/tripwires`
   if the exact ID isn't visible in the UI.

Subscribe to the resulting topic the same way as the regulated-scene example above, substituting
the region/tripwire topic and IDs.

## Notes

- All of the above are read-only from the agent's perspective once wired up — the actual
  alerting/dashboard/integration logic runs in the user's own consumer application, subscribing to
  these MQTT topics (or scripting against them) independently of the deployment scripts in this
  skill.
- If the user's goal implies a specific downstream system (a ticketing tool, a database, a
  notification service), that integration code is outside this skill's scope — the deliverable
  here is getting the right SceneScape topic/event wired up and confirmed working (e.g. one
  observed message), then handing off.
