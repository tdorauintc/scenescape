# Tracker Evaluation Pipeline – AI Agent Guide

## Mission & Scope

- Provide an offline, scriptable harness for benchmarking tracker implementations against canonical datasets and evaluation toolkits.
- Coordinate dataset adapters, tracker harnesses, and evaluator plugins through a single Pipeline Engine defined in [pipeline_engine.py](pipeline_engine.py).

## Constraints

- Phase 1 constraints:
  - only batch mode is supported (read/process/write all data at once), although class interfaces and I/O utilities may use streaming API underneath
  - the only supported dataset is Unity dataset

## Quick Links

- Architecture & flow: [docs/design/tracker-evaluation-pipeline.md](../../../docs/design/tracker-evaluation-pipeline.md)
- Main tracker evaluation README (canonical formats, usage, CLI): [README.md](README.md)
- ADR context: [docs/adr/0009-tracking-evaluation.md](../../../docs/adr/0009-tracking-evaluation.md)
- Example configurations:
  - Full tracker evaluation: [pipeline_configs/metric_test_evaluation.yaml](pipeline_configs/metric_test_evaluation.yaml)
  - Camera projection accuracy: [pipeline_configs/camera_projection_evaluation.yaml](pipeline_configs/camera_projection_evaluation.yaml)
  - Black-box suite configs (default Unity dataset): [pipeline_configs/black_box_unity/](pipeline_configs/black_box_unity/); Wildtrack variant: [pipeline_configs/black_box_wildtrack/](pipeline_configs/black_box_wildtrack/)

## Folders structure

- `.venv/` – local virtual environment for running pytest and CLI commands (never commit contents).
- `base/` – shared abstractions wiring datasets, harnesses, and evaluators; reference here before extending component folders.
- `datasets/` – dataset component group; hosts concrete dataset adapters
  - `datasets/tests/` - component-specific unit tests
- `harnesses/` – tracker harness component group; hosts concrete harness adapters with service-specific runners
  - `harnesses/tests/` - component-specific unit tests
- `evaluators/` – evaluator component group; hosts concrete metrics evaluation adapters (e.g., TrackEval wrapper)
  - `evaluators/tests/` - component-specific unit tests
- `pipeline_configs/` – sample YAML pipelines used by `pipeline_engine.py` for smoke and regression tests.
- `tests/` – pytest suites covering pipeline engine plus per-component integration tests.
- `utils/` – reusable helpers (format converters, stream loaders) shared across component groups.

## Datasets

- **UnityDataset**: `datasets/unity_dataset.py`
  - dataset location in the repository: `../../../tests/system/metric/unity_dataset/`
    It contains:
    - ground-truth file
    - scene configuration in non-canonical format (however accepted by SceneControllerHarness implementation)
    - JSONL files with camera detections for 1, 10 and 30 FPS in canonical format
    - input camera videos (currently unused)

Check `datasets/README.md` for more details

## Harnesses

- **SceneControllerHarness**: `harnesses/scene_controller_harness/scene_controller_harness.py`
  - The wrapper for scene controller that runs Python script `run_tracker.py` in the scene-controller container.
  - Dependent on internal implementation: loads configuration file and calls API of Scenescape classes from scene_common and controller modules.
  - Uses separate frame ingestion logic depending on enabling time-chunking in the configuration.

- **BlackBoxHarness**: `harnesses/black_box_harness/black_box_harness.py`
  - Black-box harness that exercises the tracker end-to-end via live MQTT messages, with no dependency on internal Scenescape Python APIs.
  - Starts an `eclipse-mosquitto` broker container and the tracker container on an isolated Docker network (`black_box_harness_{run_id}`); both are removed after the run.
  - Publishes each input frame to `scenescape/data/camera/{camera_id}` and collects tracker outputs from `scenescape/data/scene/{scene_id}/+`.
  - Frames are published as fast as possible. **Frames always carry original dataset timestamps**; no rewriting occurs. Both the Controller (`--maxlag 1e15`) and Tracker Service (`max_lag_s: 1e15` in config) are configured to accept historical timestamps.
  - Starts a **Mock Manager REST API** (`mock_manager.py`) as a thread on the Docker host. Both container types load scene configuration from it via HTTP on startup. The mock server computes camera extrinsics using the same logic as production (`PointCorrespondenceTransform._calculatePoseMat()` in `scene_common/transform.py`): `cv2.solvePnP` with coplanarity check, full 14-coefficient distortion array, and `_poseMatToPose()` scale extraction.
  - **Supports two container types** (must be specified explicitly via the required `container_type` config key):
    - `controller` (`intel/scenescape-controller`): Connects to mock Manager via `--resturl`; camera dicts include `camera points`/`map points` so `Camera.__init__` builds a `PointCorrespondenceTransform`. Time-chunking controlled by `time_chunking_enabled` in tracker-config.json.
    - `tracker` (`intel/scenescape-tracker`): Connects to mock Manager via `scenes.source: api` in config.json; camera extrinsics (translation, XYZ Euler degrees, scale) are served by the mock Manager. Auth file written as `{"user": "harness", "password": "harness"}` (required by `api_scene_loader.cpp`). Time-chunking always active via `time_chunking_rate_fps`.
  - `set_custom_config()` accepts:
    - `tracker_config_path` (**required**): path to the tracker config JSON mounted into the container.
    - `broker_image` (**required**): Docker image for the MQTT broker (e.g. `"eclipse-mosquitto:2.1-alpine"`).
    - `container_type` (**required**): `'controller'` or `'tracker'`.
    - `drain_timeout` (default `5.0`): seconds to wait for final tracker outputs after the last frame.
    - `startup_wait_s` (default `2.0`): seconds to wait after container starts before publishing frames.
    - `scene_id`: overrides the scene UID derived from `set_scene_config()`.
    - `enable_metrics` (default `false`): run an OTEL Collector sidecar to capture OTLP metrics. Requires `metrics_collector_image` (e.g. `"otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.155.0"`); optional `metrics_export_interval_s` (default `2`) and `metrics_otlp_port` (default `4317`).
  - **Observability (optional)**: when `enable_metrics` is set, an OTEL Collector container is added to the run network. The controller (via `CONTROLLER_ENABLE_METRICS`/`CONTROLLER_METRICS_ENDPOINT` env) or tracker service (via `observability.metrics` + `infrastructure.otlp` config) push OTLP/gRPC metrics to it; the collector's `file` exporter writes them out, and `metrics_recorder.py` aggregates them into `metrics_summary.txt` (histograms: count/avg/min/max; counters: total + per-export delta stats; gauges: avg/min/max/median). It then verifies dropped frames (`scenescape_controller_mqtt_messages_dropped` + `tracker.mqtt.dropped`) and warns when the dropped/output-frame ratio exceeds 1%.
  - After the run, writes `inputs.json` and `outputs.json` to the output folder (if `set_output_folder()` was called), creating the directory automatically if it does not exist.
  - Also copies the source tracker configuration file into `<output_folder>/config/` (both container types), preserving the original filename. For the Tracker Service the effective `config.json` is derived from this file by the harness (MQTT/Manager endpoints, `max_lag_s=1e15`, optional OTLP/metrics), so the copy captures the source config, not the fully-resolved runtime config.
  - Pair this harness with any evaluator (TrackEval, Diagnostic, Jitter) and configs under `pipeline_configs/black_box_unity/` (default) or `pipeline_configs/black_box_wildtrack/`.

- **CameraProjectionHarness**: `harnesses/camera_projection_harness/camera_projection_harness.py`
  - Bypasses the full tracker and only applies camera-pose projection to isolate per-camera calibration error.
  - Runs `run_projection.py` inside the `intel/scenescape-controller` Docker container (requires `scene_common`, OpenCV, open3d).
  - Supports two projection modes per object category via the `object_classes` custom config key:
    - **TYPE_1** (`shift_type: 1`, default): projects bounding-box bottom-centre `(centre_x, bottom_y)` to world XY plane using `CameraPose.cameraPointToWorldPoint()`.
    - **TYPE_2** (`shift_type: 2`): shifts the projection point upward by `(height/2) * (baseAngle/90)` before projecting, using `CameraPose.projectBounds()` to derive the base angle.
  - After projection, applies a size offset: pushes the world position `mean([x_size, y_size]) / 2` metres away from the camera, matching `MovingObject.mapObjectDetectionToWorld()`.
  - `set_custom_config()` accepts `object_classes` (list of `{name, shift_type, x_size, y_size}` dicts) and `container_image`.
  - `process_inputs()` serialises `object_classes` to `params.json` in the shared temp dir before launching the container; `run_projection.py` reads it at startup.
  - `reset()` clears `_object_classes` in addition to other state.
  - Encodes output object IDs as `"{camera_id}:{object_id}"` for downstream splitting by `CameraAccuracyEvaluator`.
  - Pair this harness with `CameraAccuracyEvaluator` and the `camera_projection_evaluation.yaml` pipeline config.

Check `harnesses/README.md` for more details

## Evaluators

- **TrackEvalEvaluator**: `evaluators/trackeval_evaluator.py`
  Wraps TrackEval library, provides tracker output format conversion and delivers state of the art tracking metrics.

- **DiagnosticEvaluator**: `evaluators/diagnostic_evaluator.py`
  Per-frame location and distance error analysis between bipartite-matched tracker output tracks and ground-truth tracks. Produces CSV and plot outputs alongside summary scalar metrics (`DIST_T_mean`, `LOC_T_X_mae`, `LOC_T_Y_mae`, `num_matches`).

- **JitterEvaluator**: `evaluators/jitter_evaluator.py`
  Measures trajectory smoothness via RMS jerk and acceleration variance, computed from both tracker outputs and ground-truth tracks. Supports GT and ratio variants to isolate tracker-added jitter from dataset-inherent jitter.

- **CameraAccuracyEvaluator**: `evaluators/camera_accuracy_evaluator.py`
  Consumes output from `CameraProjectionHarness` and measures per-camera, per-object projection accuracy:
  - `DIST_T`: mean Euclidean distance error (m) between projected and GT world position per (camera, object) pair.
  - `VISIBILITY`: frame count and percentage each camera detects each object.
  - `set_scene_config()` resolves each camera's world position (`_solve_camera_position`: `cv2.solvePnP` → `C = -R^T @ t`) and 2-D viewing direction (`_solve_camera_view_dir`: `R^T @ [0, 0, 1]`, XY normalized) from the scene's calibration data.
  - `trajectories_{cam}.png` includes a star marker at the camera position and an arrow showing its view direction; both X and Y axes are flipped when `cam_y > mean(gt_y)` (180° rotation so camera always appears at visual bottom with correct chirality).
  - Writes `distance_errors.csv`, `visibility_summary.csv`, `accuracy_summary.csv`, `summary_table.csv` (human-readable column names), per-camera `distance_errors_{cam}.png`, `trajectories_{cam}.png`, and `error_vs_cam_distance_{cam}.png` plots, and a `visibility_bar_chart.png`. `format_summary()` returns a terminal-ready table.

Multiple evaluators can be configured in a single YAML pipeline; each runs independently against the same tracker outputs and writes results to its own subfolder under the run output directory.

Check `evaluators/README.md` for more details

## Code Entry Points

- **Black-box evaluation suite**: [run_black_box_evaluation.py](run_black_box_evaluation.py) — runs all three black-box configs (Controller-NO-TC, Controller-TC, Tracker-Service) in a single timestamped session. Usage: `python -m run_black_box_evaluation [--output <path>]`. Results land under `<output>/<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>/`; see [README.md](README.md) for full output structure.
- **Mock Manager REST API**: [harnesses/black_box_harness/mock_manager.py](harnesses/black_box_harness/mock_manager.py) — minimal Manager REST server (`/api/v1/auth`, `/api/v1/scenes`, `/api/v1/camera/<uid>`) started by BlackBoxHarness on the Docker host. Computes camera extrinsics with production-identical math from `PointCorrespondenceTransform`.
- **Metrics recorder**: [harnesses/black_box_harness/metrics_recorder.py](harnesses/black_box_harness/metrics_recorder.py) — parses the OTEL Collector `file` exporter output and writes `metrics_summary.txt` (per-metric min/max/avg, plus median for counters/gauges). Exposes `collect_metric_values()` (structured per-metric values) and `check_dropped_frames()` (dropped-frame count + ratio check).
- **Pipeline orchestration**: [pipeline_engine.py](pipeline_engine.py) (methods `load_configuration()`, `run()`, `evaluate()`, CLI via `python -m pipeline_engine <config>`).
  - `_configure_harness()` forwards `object_classes` from the YAML `harness.config` block to the harness via `set_custom_config({'object_classes': ...})`.
  - `_configure_evaluators()` calls `set_scene_config(scene_config)` on each evaluator that exposes the method (checked via `hasattr`), passing the scene config returned by `dataset.get_scene_config()`.
  - `main()` prints evaluator results using `evaluator.format_summary()` when available; otherwise falls back to printing each metric value individually.
- **Component base classes** (implement to extend pipeline):
  - Dataset: [base/tracking_dataset.py](base/tracking_dataset.py)
  - Harness: [base/tracker_harness.py](base/tracker_harness.py)
  - Evaluator: [base/tracker_evaluator.py](base/tracker_evaluator.py)
- **TrackEval adapter & helpers**: [evaluators/trackeval_evaluator.py](evaluators/trackeval_evaluator.py), [utils/format_converters/](./utils/format_converters.py).
- **Jitter adapter**: [evaluators/jitter_evaluator.py](evaluators/jitter_evaluator.py).
- **Diagnostic adapter**: [evaluators/diagnostic_evaluator.py](evaluators/diagnostic_evaluator.py).
- **Camera projection harness**: [harnesses/camera_projection_harness/camera_projection_harness.py](harnesses/camera_projection_harness/camera_projection_harness.py), container script: [harnesses/camera_projection_harness/run_projection.py](harnesses/camera_projection_harness/run_projection.py).
- **Camera accuracy evaluator**: [evaluators/camera_accuracy_evaluator.py](evaluators/camera_accuracy_evaluator.py).

## Guidelines for Adding New Component or Updating Existing One

1. **Understand requirements**
   - Review the design doc and main README sections relevant to datasets, harnesses, or evaluators you plan to modify.
   - Confirm whether changes affect canonical formats; if yes, update main README and converters accordingly.
2. **Implement / modify components**
   - Add new classes under `<component_group>/` and register them via YAML `class` paths.
   - Keep constructors side-effect free; configuration happens through explicit setters invoked by PipelineEngine.
   - If tools/tracker/evaluation/utils do not include utilites for reading / writing / converting common data formats (json, jsonl, csv), do not implement custom logic in the component. Instead loop in human and suggest extending the utilities with a new function
   - Update `requirements.txt` if new dependencies are added
3. **Add / update unit tests**
   - Add or update unit tests specific for this component that cover added / modified code
   - Update integration / pipeline engine tests if component interfaces or configuration is affected
4. **Update configuration & docs**
   - Provide a sample entry in `pipeline_configs/*.yaml` (existing or a new file) demonstrating new options.
   - Record limitations or new behaviors in README (“Phase 1 Limitations” or relevant section).
5. **Run tests**
   - Run unit tests covering the changed component(s)
   - Run integration tests
   - Run full pipeline test with `pipeline_engine.py`

## Tests

### Structure

- `datasets/tests/` - component-specific unit tests
- `harnesses/tests/` - component-specific unit tests
- `evaluators/tests/` - component-specific unit tests
- `tests/` – pytest suites covering format converters, pipeline engine plus per-component integration tests.

### Running tests

- Use .venv for running: `cd tools/tracker/evaluation && source .venv/bin/activate`, loop in human if venv is not found
- Unit tests: `pytest . -v -m "not integration"`
- Integration tests: `pytest . -v -m "integration"`
- Unit & integration: `pytest tests/ -q --tb=short`.
- PipelineEngine test: `pytest tests/test_pipeline_engine.py -v`.
- Full pipeline test via CLI `python pipeline_engine.py pipeline_configs/metric_test_evaluation.yaml` to ensure dataset → harness → evaluator flow succeeds.

## I/O, Data Formats and Conversions

- Reading and writing to files should use primitives from `tools/tracker/evaluation/utils/format_converters.py` optimized for speed and high data volume.
- Filesystem I/O should use streaming API where possible to support large files and optimize for memory usage

## Key Guidelines

- Favor declarative configuration; add new knobs to YAML and plumb them through component `set_*` or `configure_*` methods.
- Ensure dataset iterators and harness processors stream data when possible; avoid loading entire sequences into memory unless documented.
- Canonical format changes require synchronized updates to converters, README, and any datasets/evaluators using them.
